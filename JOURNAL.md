# Development Journal

## 2025-10-15: Project Initialization and Phase 1 Foundation

### Overview

Started the Vibe Personal Dashboard Backend project - a Go-based RESTful API service for querying metrics from a database using configuration-driven metric definitions.

### What We Accomplished Today

#### 1. Project Documentation (PR #2 - Merged)
- Created **CLAUDE.md**: Development guidelines and collaboration principles for future Claude Code instances
- Created **DESIGN.md**: Complete architectural design document covering all system layers
- Created **PLAN.md**: High-level implementation plan broken into 5 phases
- Created **IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Comprehensive 2,500+ line step-by-step TDD implementation guide
- Added SQLite feature to devcontainer configuration
- Fixed bug: `w.WriteStatus()` → `w.WriteHeader()` in handler example code
- Updated module name throughout to `github.com/roryirvine/vibe-personal-dashboard-backend`

#### 2. Phase 1: Foundation (PR #3 - Awaiting Merge)
- Initialized Go module with correct module name
- Created complete project directory structure following Go conventions
- Updated .gitignore with appropriate patterns for binaries, databases, test artifacts, IDE files

### Architecture Decisions Made

Through collaborative brainstorming with Rory, we established:

**Configuration Format:**
- Using TOML for metrics configuration (clean syntax, popular in Go ecosystem)
- Fixed conventional path: `./config/metrics.toml`

**Query Parameters:**
- Mixed approach: some metrics static, some parameterized
- Positional placeholders (`?`) with type validation (string, int, float)
- URL query parameters for runtime values

**API Response Format:**
- Array of objects: `[{"name": "metric1", "value": <value>}, ...]`
- Extensible for adding metadata later

**Requesting Multiple Metrics:**
- Query parameter with comma-separated names: `GET /metrics?names=metric1,metric2`

**Caching:**
- No caching initially (YAGNI principle)
- Can add later if performance requires it

**Configuration Management:**
- Restart required for config changes (simpler, more predictable)
- DB path via `DB_PATH` environment variable
- Port via `PORT` environment variable

**HTTP Router:**
- Chi router (lightweight, idiomatic, good middleware support)

### Problems Encountered and Solved

1. **Bug in IMPLEMENTATION.md**:
   - Issue: Handler code used `w.WriteStatus(status)` instead of correct `w.WriteHeader(status)`
   - Found by: Code reviewer
   - Fixed in: Commit 4b29134
   - Merged into feature branch via d3dcc7b

2. **Module Name Placeholder**:
   - Issue: IMPLEMENTATION.md had placeholder `github.com/yourusername/...`
   - Fixed by: Global replace with `github.com/roryirvine/vibe-personal-dashboard-backend`
   - Removed outdated instructions about replacing username

### Current Project State

**Repository Status:**
- Main branch: Clean, contains only documentation
- Feature branch `feature/phase-1-foundation`: Contains Phase 1 implementation
- PR #3: Open, awaiting merge

**Completed:**
- ✅ All documentation
- ✅ Development environment setup (devcontainer with Go, Node.js, SQLite)
- ✅ Go module initialization
- ✅ Project structure
- ✅ .gitignore configuration

**Next Phase:**
- Phase 2: Models Package (pending PR #3 merge)

### Todo List for Phase 2 Implementation

When resuming work, follow IMPLEMENTATION.md starting at "Phase 2: Models Package":

#### Verification Before Moving to Phase 3
- [ ] All model tests passing: `go test ./internal/models/ -v`
- [ ] All files have package comments
- [ ] Code follows TDD approach (tests written first)
- [ ] Clean commit history

### Key Principles to Remember

**TDD**: Always write the failing test first, then implement just enough code to pass
**YAGNI**: Only implement what's required now
**KISS**: Choose the simplest solution that works
**Commit Frequently**: After each logical unit of work

### Notes for Tomorrow

- Phase 1 PR (#3) needs to be merged before starting Phase 2
- Implementer should work from the feature branch that will be created from main after merge
- Follow IMPLEMENTATION.md guide strictly - it has all the code examples and test patterns
- Each task in Phase 2 should have its own commit
- Run tests after each task to ensure they pass before committing

## 2025-10-16: Documentation Updates - Code Comment Standards

### Prompt

Rory asked me to review IMPLEMENTATION.md against the new code comment guidelines in CLAUDE.md and suggest any comments that need to be added to comply with the instructions.

### What I Did

1. **Reviewed IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Read through all 2,454 lines of code examples
2. **Identified missing package comments**: Found that 12 files were missing required package-level documentation
3. **Added package comments**: Added concise (1-line) package comments to all code examples:
   - `param_type.go`: "Defines parameter types supported in metric queries."
   - `param_definition.go`: "Defines parameter definitions for metric queries with validation."
   - `metric.go`: "Defines metric configuration structure with query and parameter definitions."
   - `metric_result.go`: "Defines the API response structure for metric results."
   - `config.go`: "Loads and validates TOML metric configuration files."
   - `repository.go`: "Defines the database repository interface for metric queries."
   - `sqlite.go`: "Implements the repository interface using SQLite."
   - `params.go`: "Converts URL query parameters to typed values for database queries."
   - `metric_service.go`: "Executes metric queries with parameter validation and concurrent execution."
   - `metrics.go` (handlers): "HTTP handlers for metrics API endpoints."
   - `router.go`: "Configures HTTP routes and middleware for the metrics API."
   - `main.go`: "Main entry point for the metrics API server."

4. **Added function comment**: Added documentation to `NewSQLiteRepository` noting that the path parameter can be a file path or ":memory:" for in-memory database

### Key Findings

The code examples were already clean and didn't violate any comment anti-patterns:
- ✅ No comments saying things are "improved", "better", "new", or "enhanced"
- ✅ No instructional comments telling developers what to do
- ✅ No comments stating the obvious
- ✅ No comments repeating what the code shows
- ✅ No temporal references like "recently refactored"

The only issue was missing package-level documentation, which is now resolved.

### Technical Insights

- CLAUDE.md requires all code files to start with a brief (≤3 lines) comment explaining what the file does
- Package comments should explain WHY the code exists, not how it's better than something else
- Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is
- The `:memory:` option for SQLite is important to document as it's used in tests and is a common pattern

### Files Modified

- IMPLEMENTATION.md: Added 12 package comments and 1 function comment

## 2025-10-16: Phase 2 Implementation - Models Package

### Prompt

Rory asked me to implement Phase 2 of the Vibe project (Models Package). We confirmed the approach: create a feature branch, commit after each task, and update the journal at the end.

### What I Did

Successfully implemented all of Phase 2 following TDD principles exactly as specified in IMPLEMENTATION.md:

#### Task 2.1: ParamType Enum
- Created `param_type.go` with custom type and constants for string, int, float
- Implemented `IsValid()` method for type validation
- Wrote comprehensive tests covering valid and invalid types
- All tests passed
- Commit: 99d7a3b "Add ParamType enum with validation"

#### Task 2.2: ParamDefinition Struct
- Created `param_definition.go` with error variables
- Implemented struct with TOML tags (Name, Type, Required)
- Implemented `Validate()` method checking for empty names and invalid types
- Wrote tests covering all validation scenarios
- All tests passed
- Commit: 6280ee8 "Add ParamDefinition with validation"

#### Task 2.3: Metric Struct
- Created `metric.go` with error variables for name and query validation
- Implemented Metric struct with Name, Query, MultiRow, and Params fields
- Implemented `Validate()` method that also validates nested parameter definitions
- Implemented `GetParamByName()` helper for parameter lookup
- Wrote comprehensive tests for validation and parameter lookup (existing/non-existing params)
- All tests passed
- Commit: 931bf21 "Add Metric struct with validation and param lookup"

#### Task 2.4: MetricResult Struct
- Created `metric_result.go` with simple struct for API responses
- Struct has Name (string) and Value (interface{}) fields with JSON tags
- No tests needed (simple data structure with no logic)
- Commit: a7173ed "Add MetricResult struct for API responses"

#### Final Verification
- Ran `go test ./internal/models/ -v`
- All 14 test cases passed (5 param type tests, 4 param definition tests, 5 metric tests)
- Test output confirms comprehensive coverage

### Current Project State

**Branch**: `feature/phase-2-models` (created from main)

**Completed Files**:
- ✅ `internal/models/param_type.go` (with package comment)
- ✅ `internal/models/param_type_test.go`
- ✅ `internal/models/param_definition.go` (with package comment)
- ✅ `internal/models/param_definition_test.go`
- ✅ `internal/models/metric.go` (with package comment)
- ✅ `internal/models/metric_test.go`
- ✅ `internal/models/metric_result.go` (with package comment)

**Test Results**:
- Total: 14 test cases
- Passed: 14
- Failed: 0
- Coverage: All validation logic, edge cases, and helper methods

**Commits**:
1. 99d7a3b - Add ParamType enum with validation
2. 6280ee8 - Add ParamDefinition with validation
3. 931bf21 - Add Metric struct with validation and param lookup
4. a7173ed - Add MetricResult struct for API responses

### Technical Insights

**TDD Process**:
- Writing tests first forced clear thinking about requirements
- Tests serve as documentation of expected behavior
- Having failing tests first confirmed implementation correctness

**Go Best Practices Applied**:
- Custom types for enums (ParamType) provide type safety
- Table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Error variables for consistent error handling
- TOML and JSON struct tags for configuration and API marshaling
- Package comments on all files as required by CLAUDE.md

**Validation Pattern**:
- Each struct has its own `Validate()` method
- Metric validation delegates to ParamDefinition validation
- Errors are descriptive and include context

### Next Steps

Phase 3 will implement the Config Package:
- Task 3.1: Install TOML parser dependency
- Task 3.2: Create Config struct and parser with TDD
- Validation for duplicate metric names
- TOML file parsing and error handling

### Key Principles Followed

✅ **TDD**: All tests written before implementation
✅ **YAGNI**: Only implemented required functionality
✅ **KISS**: Simple, straightforward implementations
✅ **Commit Frequently**: One commit per task as specified
✅ **Package Comments**: All files have required documentation

## 2025-10-16: Phase 2 Review - Error Handling Pattern Decision

### Prompt

Rory reviewed the Phase 2 implementation and questioned whether we should use `errors.Is()` for error comparison instead of direct equality, and whether we should wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf` at the model layer to add context.

### Analysis

Examined the error handling pattern across all layers of the architecture:

**Current Pattern:**
- **Models layer**: Returns sentinel errors directly (e.g., `return ErrParamNameEmpty`)
- **Config layer**: Wraps errors with context (e.g., `fmt.Errorf("invalid metric %s: %w", metric.Name, err)`)
- **Service layer**: Adds parameter/query context when needed
- **Handler layer**: Converts to HTTP errors with full context

**Tests:**
- Models: Use direct equality (`err != tt.wantErr`)
- This is appropriate for sentinel error testing at the model layer

### Decision

**Kept the current implementation** - no changes needed.

### Rationale

1. **Clean Separation of Concerns**
   - Model layer validates *structure* (is the data valid?)
   - Config layer adds *identity* (which metric failed?)
   - Service layer adds *operation* context (what query failed?)
   - Handler layer provides *user-facing* errors

2. **No Redundant Messages**
   - Context is added exactly once at each layer where it's meaningful
   - Final error: "invalid metric users_by_date: parameter name cannot be empty"
   - Clear, actionable, not repetitive

3. **Follows Go Best Practices**
   - Matches stdlib pattern (e.g., `os.PathError` wraps base errors with file path)
   - Sentinel errors at base layer, wrapped errors at higher layers
   - Internal package doesn't need `errors.Is()` complexity

4. **Keeps Tests Simple**
   - Direct equality checks at model layer test exactly what they should
   - No need for `errors.Is()` when testing sentinel errors directly
   - Tests remain focused on their layer's concerns

5. **Architecture-Appropriate**
   - This is an **application** (not a library)
   - Errors always flow through config layer before being seen
   - Config layer is the natural place to add metric name context
   - External callers don't consume model errors directly

### When the Alternative Would Be Better

Using `errors.Is()` and wrapping at every layer would be appropriate if:
- Building a **public library** where model errors might be consumed directly
- Need to check error types across package boundaries
- Multiple error paths bypass the config layer
- External code needs to unwrap to specific error types

But for this internal application architecture, KISS wins.

### Technical Insight

**Error Context Layering Pattern:**
```
Models:  ErrParamNameEmpty
         ↓
Config:  "invalid metric %s: %w" → "invalid metric users_by_date: parameter name cannot be empty"
         ↓
Service: "invalid parameters: %w" → "invalid parameters: invalid metric users_by_date: parameter name cannot be empty"
         ↓
Handler: HTTP 500 with full error chain
```

Each layer adds exactly the context it knows about, building a clear error trail without redundancy.

### Reference

- IMPLEMENTATION.md:752 shows config layer wrapping pattern
- Phase 2 code review confirmed implementation correctness
- Follows KISS principle from CLAUDE.md

## 2025-10-16: Phase 3 Implementation - Config Package

### Prompt

Rory asked me to implement Phase 3 of the Vibe project (Config Package). We confirmed: create a new feature branch from main (Phase 2 already merged), use test fixtures for config files, no duplicate parameter name validation (YAGNI), and continue the sentinel error pattern.

### What I Did

Successfully implemented all of Phase 3 following TDD principles as specified in IMPLEMENTATION.md:

#### Task 3.1: Install TOML Parser Dependency
- Ran `go get github.com/BurntSushi/toml`
- Verified dependency added to go.mod (version 1.5.0)
- Commit: c4844a0 "Add TOML parser dependency"

#### Task 3.2: Create Config Struct and Parser (TDD)
- **Step 1: Wrote tests first** (TDD approach)
  - Created `config_test.go` with four test cases:
    1. Valid config with 2 metrics (one simple, one with params)
    2. Nonexistent file error handling
    3. Invalid TOML syntax error handling
    4. Duplicate metric name detection
  - Used `t.TempDir()` for isolated test fixtures
  - Tests initially failed (as expected in TDD)

- **Step 2: Implemented code to pass tests**
  - Created `config.go` with:
    - `Config` struct wrapping `[]models.Metric`
    - `LoadConfig()` function using `toml.DecodeFile()`
    - `validateMetrics()` helper for duplicate detection and metric validation
  - Package comment: "Loads and validates TOML metric configuration files."
  - Error wrapping adds metric name context: `fmt.Errorf("invalid metric %s: %w", metric.Name, err)`

- **Step 3: Fixed and verified**
  - Removed unused import from test file
  - All 4 test cases passed
  - Commit: 5b7c2f5 "Add config loading with TOML parsing and validation"

#### Post-Implementation Fixes
- **Fix 1: TOML dependency incorrectly marked as indirect**
  - Issue: `go get` ran before importing, causing `// indirect` comment
  - Fix: Ran `go mod tidy` to properly mark as direct dependency
  - Commit: de5d7ca "Fix TOML dependency marked as direct (not indirect)"

- **Fix 2: Missing test case for empty metrics array**
  - Issue: `validateMetrics()` returns error for empty array but no test coverage
  - Fix: Added 5th test case for valid TOML file with no metrics defined
  - All 5 test cases now pass
  - Commit: 253eeee "Add test case for empty metrics array in config"

#### Final Verification
- Ran `go test ./...` to verify all packages still work
- Results:
  - `internal/config`: 5 tests passed (added empty metrics test)
  - `internal/models`: 14 tests passed (cached from Phase 2)
  - Total: 19 tests passing

### Current Project State

**Branch**: `feature/phase-3-config` (created from main)

**Completed Files**:
- ✅ `internal/config/config.go` (with package comment)
- ✅ `internal/config/config_test.go`
- ✅ go.mod updated with TOML dependency
- ✅ go.sum created with dependency checksums

**Test Results**:
- Config package: 5 test cases (all scenarios covered)
- Models package: 14 test cases (from Phase 2)
- Total passing: 19 tests
- Failed: 0

**Commits**:
1. c4844a0 - Add TOML parser dependency
2. 5b7c2f5 - Add config loading with TOML parsing and validation
3. ad2fed5 - Update journal with Phase 3 implementation summary
4. de5d7ca - Fix TOML dependency marked as direct (not indirect)
5. 253eeee - Add test case for empty metrics array in config

### Technical Insights

**TDD Benefits Demonstrated**:
- Writing tests first clarified exactly what LoadConfig() should do
- Test fixtures using `t.TempDir()` provide clean isolation
- Failing tests confirmed implementation was needed
- Passing tests confirmed correctness

**TOML Parsing Pattern**:
- `toml.DecodeFile()` directly populates struct with TOML tags
- Nested structures (metrics with params) work automatically
- Parse errors are descriptive and include line numbers

**Validation Strategy**:
- Parse TOML first, validate structure second (separation of concerns)
- Empty metrics array rejected early
- Duplicate detection using map for O(n) performance
- Each metric validated using its own `Validate()` method (delegation)

**Error Context Layering** (continuing Phase 2 pattern):
```
Models:  ErrParamNameEmpty
         ↓
Config:  "invalid metric %s: %w" → "invalid metric test_metric: parameter name cannot be empty"
```

The config layer adds the metric name, which is exactly the context this layer knows about.

**Test Fixture Strategy**:
- Using temporary directories with `t.TempDir()` instead of actual config files
- Each test creates its own isolated TOML file
- Phase 8 will create the actual `config/metrics.toml` for running the service
- This keeps tests fast, isolated, and not dependent on external files

### Next Steps

Phase 4 will implement the Repository Layer:
- Task 4.1: Define Repository interface
- Task 4.2: Install SQLite driver (modernc.org/sqlite)
- Task 4.3: Implement SQLite repository with TDD
  - `QuerySingleValue()` for single metrics
  - `QueryMultiRow()` for multi-row metrics
  - Connection pooling and context support
  - Comprehensive tests with in-memory database

### Key Principles Followed

✅ **TDD**: Tests written before implementation, verified failures, then verified passes
✅ **YAGNI**: No duplicate parameter validation, no hot-reload, no advanced features
✅ **KISS**: Simple map-based duplicate detection, straightforward validation
✅ **Commit Frequently**: Two commits for two distinct tasks
✅ **Package Comments**: Required documentation included
✅ **Error Pattern Consistency**: Continued sentinel errors with context wrapping

### Reference

- IMPLEMENTATION.md:546-773 (Phase 3: Config Package)
- DESIGN.md:222-228 (TOML format rationale)
- All tests passing: `go test ./...`

## 2025-10-17: IMPLEMENTATION.md Refactoring - Principles Over Prescriptions

### Prompt

Rory received feedback that IMPLEMENTATION.md was too focused on providing exact code examples rather than explaining the architectural reasoning behind decisions. He asked if I agreed, then requested I refactor Phase 3 only to test a different approach - focusing on helping implementers understand the task conceptually rather than providing templates to copy.

### What I Did

**Analysis**: I agreed with the feedback. The existing Phase 3 content (tasks 3.1-3.2) was:
- Showing exact function signatures and code structures
- Providing complete test files as templates
- Prescribing specific implementations
- Not explaining WHY architectural choices were made

**Refactoring Approach**: Rewrote Phase 3 to shift from "here's the code" to "here's why we make these choices":

#### Task 3.1: Install TOML Parser Dependency
- **Before**: Just showed the command and expected output
- **After**:
  - Explained WHY we chose TOML (human-readable configuration)
  - Explained WHY this specific library (most mature in Go ecosystem)
  - Explained WHAT go.mod does (dependency management context)
  - Still provided the command, but with understanding

#### Task 3.2: Create Config Struct and Parser
- **Before**: 150+ lines of exact test code and implementation code
- **After**:
  - **The problem we're solving**: Clear statement of what config loading needs to do
  - **Why validation at load time**: Fail fast philosophy, operational benefits
  - **Architecture decisions**: Explained 3 key decisions:
    1. Single responsibility (what config package should/shouldn't do)
    2. Validation layering (config-level vs model-level validation)
    3. Error handling philosophy (wrapping for context)
  - **Design approach**: Described WHAT to build without HOW:
    - What test cases matter and WHY
    - What components are needed (Config struct, LoadConfig func, validateMetrics helper)
    - What Go patterns to use (error wrapping, fail fast)
    - What success looks like
  - **No code templates**: Removed all detailed implementation examples

**Outcome**: Reduced Phase 3 from ~240 lines to ~90 lines, with much higher signal-to-noise ratio.

### Technical Insights

**Documentation Philosophy Shift**:
- **Template-driven**: "Copy this exact code structure"
  - Pros: Easy to follow mechanically
  - Cons: Implementer doesn't understand choices, can't adapt, doesn't learn architecture

- **Principle-driven**: "Here's what to build and why it matters"
  - Pros: Implementer understands trade-offs, can make informed decisions, learns architecture
  - Cons: Requires more thinking, slower initial implementation

**Key Changes Made**:
1. Lead with the "why" - what problem does this solve?
2. Explain architectural reasoning - why these choices over alternatives?
3. Describe components conceptually - what they should do, not exact syntax
4. Focus on test cases as behavior specifications
5. Provide design patterns, not code templates

**What We Kept**:
- Command-line instructions (these are objective facts)
- Test strategy descriptions (these explain behavior)
- Verification steps (these confirm correctness)
- References to Go patterns (wrapping errors, fail fast)

**What We Removed**:
- Complete test file listings
- Complete implementation file listings
- Exact function signatures
- Specific variable names and struct layouts

### Example Transformation

**Before**:
```
File to create: internal/config/config.go

Code:
[150 lines of exact Go code]
```

**After**:
```
You'll need:

1. A Config struct: This is a wrapper around []models.Metric with TOML struct tags...

2. A LoadConfig function:
   - Takes a file path string
   - Uses toml.DecodeFile() to parse
   - Calls a validation function
   - Returns []models.Metric and an error

3. A validateMetrics helper:
   - Checks at least one metric exists
   - Uses map[string]bool to detect duplicates
   - Returns descriptive errors
```

### Files Modified

- IMPLEMENTATION.md: Refactored Phase 3 (lines 546-635)
  - Task 3.1: Added "why" context for TOML choice
  - Task 3.2: Complete rewrite to focus on architecture and reasoning
  - Removed ~150 lines of code templates
  - Added explanations of design decisions

### Commit

- 093533d "Refactor Phase 3 to explain why rather than show exact code"

### Next Steps

If this approach works well for Rory and future implementers, we should:
1. Apply the same refactoring to other phases
2. Focus on architectural reasoning throughout
3. Trust implementers to make good implementation choices within the architectural constraints
4. Keep the document as a guide, not a template

### Key Principle

**Teaching architecture over teaching syntax**: The implementer already knows Go. What they need to learn is:
- Why this architecture?
- What problems does each layer solve?
- What are the trade-offs of these choices?
- How do the pieces fit together conceptually?

This refactoring embodies the CLAUDE.md principle: "We're colleagues working together" - treating the implementer as a capable engineer who needs context, not a junior who needs their hand held with exact code.
