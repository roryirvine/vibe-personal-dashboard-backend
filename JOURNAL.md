## 2025-10-15: Project Initialization and Phase 1 Foundation

### Overview

Started the Vibe Personal Dashboard Backend project - a Go-based RESTful API service for querying metrics from a database using configuration-driven metric definitions.

### What We Accomplished Today

#### 1. Project Documentation (PR #2 - Merged)
- Created **CLAUDE.md**: Development guidelines and collaboration principles for future Claude Code instances
- Created **DESIGN.md**: Complete architectural design document covering all system layers
- Created **PLAN.md**: High-level implementation plan broken into 5 phases
- Created **IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Comprehensive 2,500+ line step-by-step TDD implementation guide
- Added SQLite feature to devcontainer configuration
- Fixed bug: `w.WriteStatus()` → `w.WriteHeader()` in handler example code
- Updated module name throughout to `github.com/roryirvine/vibe-personal-dashboard-backend`

#### 2. Phase 1: Foundation (PR #3 - Awaiting Merge)
- Initialized Go module with correct module name
- Created complete project directory structure following Go conventions
- Updated .gitignore with appropriate patterns for binaries, databases, test artifacts, IDE files

### Architecture Decisions Made

Through collaborative brainstorming with Rory, we established:

**Configuration Format:**
- Using TOML for metrics configuration (clean syntax, popular in Go ecosystem)
- Fixed conventional path: `./config/metrics.toml`

**Query Parameters:**
- Mixed approach: some metrics static, some parameterized
- Positional placeholders (`?`) with type validation (string, int, float)
- URL query parameters for runtime values

**API Response Format:**
- Array of objects: `[{"name": "metric1", "value": <value>}, ...]`
- Extensible for adding metadata later

**Requesting Multiple Metrics:**
- Query parameter with comma-separated names: `GET /metrics?names=metric1,metric2`

**Caching:**
- No caching initially (YAGNI principle)
- Can add later if performance requires it

**Configuration Management:**
- Restart required for config changes (simpler, more predictable)
- DB path via `DB_PATH` environment variable
- Port via `PORT` environment variable

**HTTP Router:**
- Chi router (lightweight, idiomatic, good middleware support)

### Problems Encountered and Solved

1. **Bug in IMPLEMENTATION.md**:
   - Issue: Handler code used `w.WriteStatus(status)` instead of correct `w.WriteHeader(status)`
   - Found by: Code reviewer
   - Fixed in: Commit 4b29134
   - Merged into feature branch via d3dcc7b

2. **Module Name Placeholder**:
   - Issue: IMPLEMENTATION.md had placeholder `github.com/yourusername/...`
   - Fixed by: Global replace with `github.com/roryirvine/vibe-personal-dashboard-backend`
   - Removed outdated instructions about replacing username

### Current Project State

**Repository Status:**
- Main branch: Clean, contains only documentation
- Feature branch `feature/phase-1-foundation`: Contains Phase 1 implementation
- PR #3: Open, awaiting merge

**Completed:**
- ✅ All documentation
- ✅ Development environment setup (devcontainer with Go, Node.js, SQLite)
- ✅ Go module initialization
- ✅ Project structure
- ✅ .gitignore configuration

**Next Phase:**
- Phase 2: Models Package (pending PR #3 merge)

### Todo List for Phase 2 Implementation

When resuming work, follow IMPLEMENTATION.md starting at "Phase 2: Models Package":

#### Task 2.1: Define ParamType Enum
- [ ] Create `internal/models/param_type.go`
- [ ] Define ParamType custom type with constants (string, int, float)
- [ ] Implement `IsValid()` method
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests in `param_type_test.go`
- [ ] Verify tests pass: `go test ./internal/models/`
- [ ] Commit: "Add ParamType enum with validation"

#### Task 2.2: Define ParamDefinition Struct
- [ ] Create `internal/models/param_definition.go`
- [ ] Define error variables (ErrParamNameEmpty, ErrInvalidParamType)
- [ ] Implement ParamDefinition struct with TOML tags
- [ ] Implement `Validate()` method
- [ ] Write tests in `param_definition_test.go` covering valid/invalid cases
- [ ] Verify tests pass
- [ ] Commit: "Add ParamDefinition with validation"

#### Task 2.3: Define Metric Struct
- [ ] Create `internal/models/metric.go`
- [ ] Add error variables (ErrMetricNameEmpty, ErrMetricQueryEmpty)
- [ ] Implement Metric struct with Name, Query, MultiRow, Params fields
- [ ] Implement `Validate()` method
- [ ] Implement `GetParamByName()` helper method
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests in `metric_test.go`
- [ ] Test validation, parameter lookup
- [ ] Verify tests pass
- [ ] Commit: "Add Metric struct with validation and param lookup"

#### Task 2.4: Define MetricResult Struct
- [ ] Create `internal/models/metric_result.go`
- [ ] Implement simple struct with Name and Value (interface{}) fields
- [ ] Add JSON tags
- [ ] No tests needed (simple data structure)
- [ ] Commit: "Add MetricResult struct for API responses"

#### Verification Before Moving to Phase 3
- [ ] All model tests passing: `go test ./internal/models/ -v`
- [ ] All files have package comments
- [ ] Code follows TDD approach (tests written first)
- [ ] Clean commit history

### Key Principles to Remember

**TDD**: Always write the failing test first, then implement just enough code to pass
**YAGNI**: Only implement what's required now
**KISS**: Choose the simplest solution that works
**Commit Frequently**: After each logical unit of work

### Notes for Tomorrow

- Phase 1 PR (#3) needs to be merged before starting Phase 2
- Implementer should work from the feature branch that will be created from main after merge
- Follow IMPLEMENTATION.md guide strictly - it has all the code examples and test patterns
- Each task in Phase 2 should have its own commit
- Run tests after each task to ensure they pass before committing

## 2025-10-16: Documentation Updates - Code Comment Standards

### Prompt

Rory asked me to review IMPLEMENTATION.md against the new code comment guidelines in CLAUDE.md and suggest any comments that need to be added to comply with the instructions.

### What I Did

1. **Reviewed IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Read through all 2,454 lines of code examples
2. **Identified missing package comments**: Found that 12 files were missing required package-level documentation
3. **Added package comments**: Added concise (1-line) package comments to all code examples:
   - `param_type.go`: "Defines parameter types supported in metric queries."
   - `param_definition.go`: "Defines parameter definitions for metric queries with validation."
   - `metric.go`: "Defines metric configuration structure with query and parameter definitions."
   - `metric_result.go`: "Defines the API response structure for metric results."
   - `config.go`: "Loads and validates TOML metric configuration files."
   - `repository.go`: "Defines the database repository interface for metric queries."
   - `sqlite.go`: "Implements the repository interface using SQLite."
   - `params.go`: "Converts URL query parameters to typed values for database queries."
   - `metric_service.go`: "Executes metric queries with parameter validation and concurrent execution."
   - `metrics.go` (handlers): "HTTP handlers for metrics API endpoints."
   - `router.go`: "Configures HTTP routes and middleware for the metrics API."
   - `main.go`: "Main entry point for the metrics API server."

4. **Added function comment**: Added documentation to `NewSQLiteRepository` noting that the path parameter can be a file path or ":memory:" for in-memory database

### Key Findings

The code examples were already clean and didn't violate any comment anti-patterns:
- ✅ No comments saying things are "improved", "better", "new", or "enhanced"
- ✅ No instructional comments telling developers what to do
- ✅ No comments stating the obvious
- ✅ No comments repeating what the code shows
- ✅ No temporal references like "recently refactored"

The only issue was missing package-level documentation, which is now resolved.

### Technical Insights

- CLAUDE.md requires all code files to start with a brief (≤3 lines) comment explaining what the file does
- Package comments should explain WHY the code exists, not how it's better than something else
- Comments should be evergreen and describe the code as it is
- The `:memory:` option for SQLite is important to document as it's used in tests and is a common pattern

### Files Modified

- IMPLEMENTATION.md: Added 12 package comments and 1 function comment

## 2025-10-16: Phase 2 Implementation - Models Package

### Prompt

Rory asked me to implement Phase 2 of the Vibe project (Models Package). We confirmed the approach: create a feature branch, commit after each task, and update the journal at the end.

### What I Did

Successfully implemented all of Phase 2 following TDD principles exactly as specified in IMPLEMENTATION.md:

#### Task 2.1: ParamType Enum
- Created `param_type.go` with custom type and constants for string, int, float
- Implemented `IsValid()` method for type validation
- Wrote comprehensive tests covering valid and invalid types
- All tests passed
- Commit: 99d7a3b "Add ParamType enum with validation"

#### Task 2.2: ParamDefinition Struct
- Created `param_definition.go` with error variables
- Implemented struct with TOML tags (Name, Type, Required)
- Implemented `Validate()` method checking for empty names and invalid types
- Wrote tests covering all validation scenarios
- All tests passed
- Commit: 6280ee8 "Add ParamDefinition with validation"

#### Task 2.3: Metric Struct
- Created `metric.go` with error variables for name and query validation
- Implemented Metric struct with Name, Query, MultiRow, and Params fields
- Implemented `Validate()` method that also validates nested parameter definitions
- Implemented `GetParamByName()` helper for parameter lookup
- Wrote comprehensive tests for validation and parameter lookup (existing/non-existing params)
- All tests passed
- Commit: 931bf21 "Add Metric struct with validation and param lookup"

#### Task 2.4: MetricResult Struct
- Created `metric_result.go` with simple struct for API responses
- Struct has Name (string) and Value (interface{}) fields with JSON tags
- No tests needed (simple data structure with no logic)
- Commit: a7173ed "Add MetricResult struct for API responses"

#### Final Verification
- Ran `go test ./internal/models/ -v`
- All 14 test cases passed (5 param type tests, 4 param definition tests, 5 metric tests)
- Test output confirms comprehensive coverage

### Current Project State

**Branch**: `feature/phase-2-models` (created from main)

**Completed Files**:
- ✅ `internal/models/param_type.go` (with package comment)
- ✅ `internal/models/param_type_test.go`
- ✅ `internal/models/param_definition.go` (with package comment)
- ✅ `internal/models/param_definition_test.go`
- ✅ `internal/models/metric.go` (with package comment)
- ✅ `internal/models/metric_test.go`
- ✅ `internal/models/metric_result.go` (with package comment)

**Test Results**:
- Total: 14 test cases
- Passed: 14
- Failed: 0
- Coverage: All validation logic, edge cases, and helper methods

**Commits**:
1. 99d7a3b - Add ParamType enum with validation
2. 6280ee8 - Add ParamDefinition with validation
3. 931bf21 - Add Metric struct with validation and param lookup
4. a7173ed - Add MetricResult struct for API responses

### Technical Insights

**TDD Process**:
- Writing tests first forced clear thinking about requirements
- Tests serve as documentation of expected behavior
- Having failing tests first confirmed implementation correctness

**Go Best Practices Applied**:
- Custom types for enums (ParamType) provide type safety
- Table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Error variables for consistent error handling
- TOML and JSON struct tags for configuration and API marshaling
- Package comments on all files as required by CLAUDE.md

**Validation Pattern**:
- Each struct has its own `Validate()` method
- Metric validation delegates to ParamDefinition validation
- Errors are descriptive and include context

### Next Steps

Phase 3 will implement the Config Package:
- Task 3.1: Install TOML parser dependency
- Task 3.2: Create Config struct and parser with TDD
- Validation for duplicate metric names
- TOML file parsing and error handling

### Key Principles Followed

✅ **TDD**: All tests written before implementation
✅ **YAGNI**: Only implemented required functionality
✅ **KISS**: Simple, straightforward implementations
✅ **Commit Frequently**: One commit per task as specified
✅ **Package Comments**: All files have required documentation
